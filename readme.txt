I think I'm doing this right, idk

2 Potentiometers: One is wind direction, other is wind intensity, max of 35 kts
LED Grid:
Top row is a turn coordinator, keep the white led in the middle, led moves in a direction that is prescriptives, use rudder coordinating with that side to correct a slip
Second from top row is altitude. Each dot is 1000 feet, going from dark to bright white, through grey for the altitude within 1000 feet
Next row is altitude in 10s of feet.
Altitudes are determined from barometric pressure, so are MSL and susceptible to temperature problems

Problem with the turn coordinator is idk how to actually have the turn coordinator figure out anything abt the turn. i BELIEVE that if the 3 axis accelerometer should be able to, as if it doesn't register a change while your turning, that means your CG(?) (I think CG is what the turn coordinator checks for slips, but once again I'm not sure) hasn't really changed, and you're going alright.
